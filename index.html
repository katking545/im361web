  <h3>One Week Before</h3>
  <p>When you get this close to the audition, you want to make sure your solo is fresh in your mind, but make sure you aren't overworking yourself! Focus on easier sessions, and run through the hard parks of your solo. Try a schedule like this:</p>
  <p>15 min. Scales</p>
  <p>10 min. Etudes</p>
  <p>20 min. Solo</p>

  <h3>One Day Before</h3>
  <p>Todays the day to make sure you're rested and ready! Drink a lot of water today, and just run through your solo once or twice.</p>
  <p>15 min. Solo</p>

<p>Most importantly, make sure youre havig fun! Solo's are a great way to show off your hard work, and the more you put into them the better you'll sound! Good luck!</p>
